# python-eclipse-cheatsheets-to-dita
The motivation for this project come from my mate Phil, who loves his [Python](https://www.python.org)...he even was talking up [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/index.html) over [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) - a programmer's best friend - and I forgot to mention to Phil something that is even better than Java and Ruby combined is [JRuby](http://jruby.org).

So Hey Phil Himself if you're still listening, I am going to assemble a small tutorial on Python so we can both learn Python togethor.

So before you rage on again about how Java is better than Python why don't you try a short beginner level course on Python:

[Codecademy Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python)

Then when you finish come along and train in the [REAL DOJO](http://www.codewars.com)

So Phil now that you are Pythonic, and I'm a Pythonista, lets work it out....I mean Python Jedi Master has a nice ring to it on my resume.....!?!???!? 

This projects originates from a Java based Project, [Debrief](http://debrief.info/) where I helped build an [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org) based publishing pipeline inside [Eclipse](http://ant.apache.org).

This project will hopefully transform [Eclipse cheat sheets](http://help.eclipse.org/mars/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.user%2Freference%2Fref-cheatsheets.htm) to DITA with [Python](https://www.python.org).

I was developing this project with IntelliJ IDEA with the Python Community Edition plugin.

The feature set of the Python plugin corresponds to PyCharm IDE Community Edition and it provides smart editing for Python scripts.
