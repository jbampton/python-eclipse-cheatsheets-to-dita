# python-eclipse-cheatsheets-to-dita
The motivation for this project come from my mate Phil, who loves his [Python](https://www.python.org)...he was talking up [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/index.html) over [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) - a programmer's best friend - and I forgot to mention to Phil something that is even better than Java and Ruby combined is [JRuby](http://jruby.org).

This projects originates from a Java based Project, [Debrief](http://debrief.info/) where I helped build an [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org) based publishing pipeline inside [Eclipse](http://ant.apache.org).

This project will hopefully transform [Eclipse cheat sheets](http://help.eclipse.org/mars/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.user%2Freference%2Fref-cheatsheets.htm) to DITA with [Python](https://www.python.org).

This code does not work yet...Phil is Pythonic, but I'm a Pythonista...so it might work out....I mean Python Jedi Master has a nice ring to it on my resume.....!?!???!?

I am developing this project with IntelliJ IDEA with the Python Community Edition plugin.

The feature set of the Python plugin corresponds to PyCharm IDE Community Edition and it provides smart editing for Python scripts.

I am using lxml - XML and HTML in Python
