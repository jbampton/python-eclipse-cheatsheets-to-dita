# python-eclipse-cheatsheets-to-dita
The motivation for this project come from my mate Phil, who loves his [Python](https://www.python.org)...he even was talking up [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/index.html) over [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) - a programmer's best friend - and I forgot to mention to Phil something that is even better than Java and Ruby combined is [JRuby](http://jruby.org).

So Hey Phil Himself if you're still listening, I am going to assemble a small tutorial on Python so we can both learn Python togethor.

So lets first both read the [Python Success Stories](https://www.python.org/about/success/).

So before you rage on again about how Java is better than Python why don't you try some short courses on Python and technology in general:

  - https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-python
  - https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python
  - https://developers.google.com/edu/python/
  - http://www.learnpython.org
  - https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line
  - https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git
  - https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git

Then when you finish come along and train in the [REAL DOJO](http://www.codewars.com) and reach your highest potential, become faster, stronger and more powerful......JEDI MASTER LEVEL.....!??!?!!  

So Phil now that you are Pythonic, and I'm a Pythonista, lets work it out....I mean Python Jedi Master has a nice ring to it on my resume.....!?!???!? 

This projects originates from a Java based Project, [Debrief](http://debrief.info/) where I helped build an [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org) based publishing pipeline inside [Eclipse](http://ant.apache.org).

This project will hopefully transform [Eclipse cheat sheets](http://help.eclipse.org/mars/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.user%2Freference%2Fref-cheatsheets.htm) to DITA with [Python](https://www.python.org).

I was developing this project with [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) with the Python Community Edition plugin.

The feature set of the Python plugin corresponds to [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) IDE Community Edition and it provides smart editing for Python scripts.
